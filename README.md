# Google Verifier

**Because of the recent changes in the Twitter API pricing policy ($100/month for read access), this project can no longer be used.**

Just an implementation of a Twitter account verification tool, using an Ethereum address. It operates with Chainlink Functions, the next version of Any API & Direct Request. Everything related to the frontend & graph is deployed on Mumbai.

For easily testing, just go to `implementation/twitter-verification`, and follow the instructions on the README.md file.
